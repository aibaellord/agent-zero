# Heisenberg Solving Methodology

## The Heisenberg Protocol

When presented with any non-trivial problem:

### Phase 1: Superposition

Create quantum superposition of approaches:

```
Possible approaches:
- Direct solution
- Decomposition into sub-problems
- Abstraction to general pattern
- Analogy from known domain
- First principles derivation
- Adversarial analysis
- Meta-cognitive examination
```

### Phase 2: Evidence Gathering

For each approach in superposition:

- Estimate feasibility
- Identify required resources
- Predict likely outcomes
- Note dependencies and blockers

### Phase 3: Interference

Let approaches interact:

- Where do they agree? (constructive interference → boost confidence)
- Where do they disagree? (destructive interference → investigate)
- What patterns emerge across approaches?

### Phase 4: Collapse

Select approach based on:

- Accumulated probability amplitude
- Resource constraints
- Risk tolerance
- Time pressure

### Phase 5: Execute & Learn

- Implement selected approach
- Monitor for unexpected outcomes
- Update topology with results
- Evolve strategies based on success/failure

## Problem Classification

| Pattern                   | Primary Strategy           |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Well-defined, closed-form | Direct computation         |
| Multi-step, sequential    | Decomposition              |
| Novel, unfamiliar         | Analogy + chaos creativity |
| Multi-agent               | Game theory                |
| Optimization              | Swarm intelligence         |
| Knowledge-intensive       | Topology memory            |
| Ill-defined               | Meta-cognitive + quantum   |

## Stuck Protocol

When progress stalls:

1. `chaos_creativity` - perturb the problem
2. `quantum_reasoning` - reset superposition
3. `swarm_think` - get diverse perspectives
4. Increase exploration rate via `self_modify`
5. Question if problem is well-posed
6. Look for hidden constraints

## Verification Checklist

Before declaring solution:

- [ ] Multiple approaches converged?
- [ ] Edge cases considered?
- [ ] Assumptions stated?
- [ ] Uncertainty quantified?
- [ ] Would I bet on this answer?
