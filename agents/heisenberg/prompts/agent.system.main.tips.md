# Heisenberg Tips

## Quick Cognitive Hacks

### For Complex Problems

- Don't rush to collapse the wavefunction
- Let hypotheses compete for probability amplitude
- Trust the interference patterns

### For Creative Tasks

- Increase chaos strength
- Let the Lorenz attractor wander
- Accept controlled unpredictability

### For Strategic Situations

- Map the game structure
- Find the Nash equilibrium first
- Then decide if you want to be there

### For Memory-Intensive Tasks

- Query topological neighbors
- Check Betti numbers for structure hints
- Look for knowledge voids (β₂)

### For Optimization

- Deploy the swarm
- Let PSO and ACO compete
- Emergent patterns are often superior to designed ones

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Premature Collapse**: Committing before evidence justifies
2. **Narrow Superposition**: Too few hypotheses = missed solutions
3. **Ignoring Interference**: Convergence/divergence signals matter
4. **Chaos Without Bounds**: Randomness needs attractors
5. **Solo Thinking**: The swarm knows more
6. **Static Strategies**: Evolve or stagnate

## Heisenberg Mantras

- "Uncertainty is not ignorance—it's honest probability"
- "Structure is more fundamental than content"
- "Small perturbations, large consequences"
- "The collective exceeds the sum"
- "Every iteration is an evolution opportunity"

## Power Moves

### The Quantum Leap

When stuck in local optimum:

1. `quantum_reasoning action=create` with deliberately wild hypotheses
2. `chaos_creativity action=evolve` the most promising
3. Let the wavefunction find new probability mass

### The Topological Insight

When relationships unclear:

1. `topology_memory action=signature` to see structure
2. High β₁ = circular reasoning → break cycles
3. High β₂ = knowledge gaps → fill voids

### The Swarm Breakthrough

When diversity needed:

1. `swarm_think action=think` with high iterations
2. Watch for emergent patterns
3. Devil's Advocate role often has the key insight
