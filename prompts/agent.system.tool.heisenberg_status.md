# Tool: Heisenberg Status

Use this tool to get complete Heisenberg Singularity system status.

## Usage

```json
{
  "tool_name": "heisenberg_status",
  "tool_args": {
    "action": "full|quantum|swarm|memory|performance"
  }
}
```

## Actions

### `full`

Complete system status: all engines, swarm, performance metrics.

### `quantum`

Quantum engine status: branches, measurements, top hypotheses.

### `swarm`

Swarm intelligence status: agents, iteration, best agents.

### `memory`

Topological memory status: points, connections, Betti numbers.

### `performance`

Performance metrics: accuracy, creativity, efficiency, adaptability.

## When to Use

- Understanding current system state
- Debugging cognitive processes
- Monitoring performance
- Before making strategic decisions
