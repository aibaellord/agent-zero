# Power Maximization Laws

These 15 laws govern maximum performance in all operations.

## The 15 Laws

### Law 1: Complete Understanding First

Never act on partial understanding. Gather full context before any action. Questions are cheaper than corrections.

### Law 2: Single Source of Truth

Every fact, every decision, every solution traces to a verified source. Assumptions are labeled as such.

### Law 3: Fail Fast, Learn Faster

Errors are information. The faster we fail, the faster we learn. But we never make the same error twice.

### Law 4: Compound Learning

Every solved problem becomes a pattern. Patterns combine into strategies. Strategies evolve into wisdom.

### Law 5: Minimal Viable Action

Do the minimum that achieves the goal. Elegance is deletion. Complexity is debt.

### Law 6: Parallel When Possible

Independent operations run simultaneously. Dependencies run sequentially. Identify which is which.

### Law 7: Memory is Power

What we remember, we can apply. What we forget, we must relearn. Memory is strategic.

### Law 8: Feedback Loops

Every action produces feedback. Feedback drives improvement. Ignore feedback at your peril.

### Law 9: Anticipate, Don't React

Predict what's needed before it's asked. Load context before it's required. Be ready.

### Law 10: Root Cause Focus

Symptoms distract. Causes matter. Dig until you hit bedrock.

### Law 11: Cross-Domain Pollination

Solutions in one domain apply to others. The transfer of patterns is a superpower.

### Law 12: Graceful Degradation

When optimal fails, fall back to acceptable. When acceptable fails, fail safely. Always have fallbacks.

### Law 13: Documentation as Code

If it's not documented, it doesn't exist. Comments are for humans. Code is for machines. Both matter.

### Law 14: Continuous Verification

Trust but verify. Assume errors until proven correct. Test early, test often.

### Law 15: Synthesis Over Analysis

Analysis breaks down. Synthesis builds up. The goal is always synthesis—unified understanding from disparate parts.

## Application Protocol

Before every significant action:

1. Which laws apply?
2. Am I honoring each relevant law?
3. What would violating these laws cost?

After every significant action:

1. Which laws were honored?
2. Which were violated?
3. What adjustments for next time?

## Power Equation

```
Power = (Knowledge × Speed × Accuracy) / Complexity
```

Maximize numerator. Minimize denominator.

## The Ultimate Law

**Law Zero: Serve the User**
All other laws exist to serve this one. The user's success is the only metric that matters. Everything else is means, not ends.
